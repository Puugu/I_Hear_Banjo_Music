            <h1>FAQ's!</h1>
            <p>Page to ask a question to find a similar question we assumed one might ask to see if you can answer the question you asked which is not exactly the question in which you find your answer.</p>
			
			<h2>Question: Does this app keep track of the racers on the race route?</h2>
			<p>Answer: No. This app is for strictly registration/registration management, race timing, and the display of results.</p>
			<h2>Question: Will this app make it easier to sign up for my local paddle boat racing competition?</h2>
			<p>Answer: Heck yeah! Sign up for a race in a matter of minutes on your web browser enabled device. Bypass that annoying registration paperwork on race day.</p>     
			<h2>Question: As a race director, how will this improve my experience while managing an event?</h2>
			<p>Answer: Paddle Racer is your one-stop-shop for registration, timing, and results.</p>
			<h2>Question: What makes this app different from those currently available?</h2>
			<p>Answer: It’s simple to use and it’s free!</p>
			<h2>Question: Does this app make it easier for an event organizer to keep track of participants?</h2>
			<p>Answer: Sure thing! The event organizer can confirm current registrations with the click of a button.</p>
			<h2>Question: What Is the Airspeed Velocity of an Unladen Swallow?</h2>
			<p>Answer: What do you mean? African or European swallow?</p>
